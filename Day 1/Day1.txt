Question:

  Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. 
  By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

  1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

  By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, 
  find the sum of the even-valued terms.

    Answer:

    var first = 1;
    var second = 1;
    var total = 0;

    while(first < 40)
    {    
        if(first % 2 == 0)
        {
          total += first
        }
       else if(second % 2 == 0) 
        {
          total += second
        }
      
        //document.write(first, ",")
        //document.write(second, ",")
        first += second;
        second += first;
       
    }

    document.write(total);
